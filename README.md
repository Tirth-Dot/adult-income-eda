# 📊 Adult Income Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Adult Income dataset (also known as the Census Income dataset). The primary objective is to analyze and visualize demographic and income-related patterns, providing insights that are commonly used for classification tasks such as predicting whether an individual earns more than $50K per year.

The analysis is conducted using **Python** in Jupyter Notebook format and findings are summarized in a professional **Power BI-style business presentation**.

## 🔍 Key Steps in Analysis

### 🧹 Data Cleaning
• **Missing Values**: Handled missing values in categorical columns (workclass, occupation, native_country)
• **Data Standardization**: Standardized categorical variables and labels for consistency
• **Data Quality Assessment**: Identified and addressed data inconsistencies

### 📊 Exploratory Analysis
• **Demographic Distributions**: Analysis of age, hours-per-week, education levels, and occupations
• **Income Breakdown**: Detailed analysis of income distribution (<=50K vs >50K)
• **Feature Relationships**: Investigated relationships between sex, education, occupation, and income
• **Correlation Analysis**: Statistical analysis of numerical features and their interdependencies

### 🎯 Key Findings
• **Missing Data**: ~5.6% missing values identified in workclass and occupation columns
• **Income Distribution**: Majority of individuals in the dataset earn <=50K annually
• **Education Impact**: Higher education levels significantly increase the probability of >50K income
• **Work Hours Correlation**: Increased working hours positively correlate with higher income brackets
• **Occupational Influence**: Job type strongly affects income distribution patterns
